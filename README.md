# Code_Refactor
Week 1 Homework
This week's project was to refactor an existing code (HTML and CSS) utilizing a "User Story" and "Acceptance Criteria". In addition to refactoring the given code, we are required to excercise our ability to use git commands (as seen below) to track our work in our GitHub repository. 

Git Commands:
"git add", "git commit",and "git push" 

## User Story (provided in the homework instructions)
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

## Acceptance Criteria (provided in the homework instructions)
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

## Why this project is important
Overall objective is to utilize our newly learned skills in html, css and git and to display our knowledge on how each element interacts with each other.

## Actions taken for this project
- I organized the index.html with HTML semantic elements
- I added "alt" tags to all images
- Ensured that the heading attribute fall in sequential order
- Updated the title
- Added descriptive comments to the html and css files
- Used git commands to add, commit, and push all changes on to GitHub repository
